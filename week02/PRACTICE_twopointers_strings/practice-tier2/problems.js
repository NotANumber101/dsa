// 1. Reverse Words In A String
// Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.
// A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.
// Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.
// Note: that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

// 2. Multiply Strings
// Given two non-negative integers num1 and num2 represented as strings, return the product of num1 and num2, also represented as a string.
// Note: You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly.

// 3. Word Search
// Given an m x n grid of characters board and a string word, return true if word exists in the grid.
// The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.
