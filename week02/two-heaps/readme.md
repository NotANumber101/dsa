A heap is a specialized binary tree that satisfies the heap property:

Min heap: The value of each node is smaller than or equal to the values of its children. The root node holds the minimum value. A min heap always prioritizes the minimum value.

Max heap: The value of each node is greater than or equal to the values of its children. The root node holds the maximum value. A max heap always prioritizes the maximum value.

Priority queue: A priority queue is an abstract data type retrieves elements based on their custom priority. It is often implemented using a heap for efficiency.

A heap is a specific data structure with a fixed ordering (min or max), while a priority queue is an abstract data type that handles custom priority requirements for elements.
